# munin-client Role

This role sets up a node as a munin-node collector. (The package is named "munin-node" which is confusing wrt Chef's usage of the term, hence the naming of this role.)

Eventually, there will be a way to specify additional plugins.

FIXME: Post-baby-steps, role cookbook rather than specifying runlist in the role directly.
